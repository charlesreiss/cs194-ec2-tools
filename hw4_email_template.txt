Dear {group_name},

For Homework 4, we will be supplying your group with access to an EC2 machine.

For this, we will supply you with two types of credentials: a password to
the Amazon Web Services web console, which will allow you to reboot, start
and stop a machine, and an SSH private key to login to that machine.

Your login is:
Username: {account}
Password: {password}

Enter this at https://404842661577.signin.aws.amazon.com/console to login
to the management console. Click 'EC2', then select 'US West (Oregon)' in
the upper-right corner.

You will be able to see all running VMs there (but not start/stop other team's),
to see only the ones assigned to your group, use the search bar at the
top of "Instances" tab to look for VMs tagged with the tag "for_user" set to the
value "{account}".

An SSH private key in OpenSSH format is attached to this email. If you are using
PuTTY to SSH, then you need to first convert this private key using the PuTTYgen
tool distributed with PuTTY.
