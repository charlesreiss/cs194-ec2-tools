Dear {group_name},

For Homework 4, we will be supplying your group with access to an EC2 machine.

For this, we will supply you with two types of credentials: a password to
the Amazon Web Services web console, which will allow you to reboot, start
and stop a machine, and an SSH private key (attached) to login to that machine.

Your login is:
Username: {account}
Password: {password}

Follow the instructions included/linked from the homework to use these credentials.

An SSH private key in OpenSSH format is attached to this email. If you are using
PuTTY to SSH, then you need to first convert this private key using the PuTTYgen
tool distributed with PuTTY.
